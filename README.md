### Avamae Test

Here is my completed Avamae test, I have managed to complete most of the tasks required in this exercise. However, I had trouble accessing the API's on "https://interview-assessment.api.avamae.co.uk/index.html" due to an outdated certification. I managed to utilize the GET API request using Axios. But when I attempted the POST request I received an SSL certification error, which I double checked by using the CURL command outlined in the requirements. I have stubbed the data to ensure that it would work if I were able to connect to the API endpoint and shown appropriate responses. 

I tried to utilize a variety of different techniques to show a variety of tools that I am capable of using, I do generally stick to one style to show consistency throughout a project.
